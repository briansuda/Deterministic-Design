This is a series of small scripts. Most output some SVG which can be used directly, or sent further through a chain to manipulate or rasterize the results.

Many of these are sample code I have used in talks and in my book Designing With Data http://designingwithdata.com

==MITLogo==
This will take a string and generate something similar to the MIT Media lab logos. Unlike the real logos, the position and color are determined from a has of the input string.

==cellular_automata==
This generates postcard Cellular Automata based on the Stephen Wolfram and the Game of Life algorithms. 

==connection_ring==
Using a list of objects and a list of their interactions, a nice wheel is drawn and arcs representing connections drawn between them

==contrast==
A series of functions used to determine contrast and hex colors from strings

==gradients==
A basic "heatmap" style bar creation script. Used to encode two variables in a dense space.

==maps==
These are a series of scripts to produce geographically related SVG output
===Joy Division===
SVG code, plus GeoNames data, to create Joy Division style maps

==overlapper==
Code to generate and place shapes inside of a polygon without overlap

==patterns==
A set of scripts producing various random patterns

==pixels==
All these scripts take an image as input and loop through the pixels to produce a stylized result of the base image.

==rings==
Converts an image's colors into a nice ring style bar-chart

==stream==
A simple script used to generate stream graphs in SVG

==to_from==
This is a chart type called to_from (for lack of a better name). It is similar to the connection_ring, but visualized as two rows rather than a ring

==windrose==
Takes direction and speed as input and produces a circular diagram representing the strength of the value in a given direction
